									<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Anime</h1>
									<p class="">Anime has been a huge part of my life since I was a very young teen. The first one I ever watched was Squid Girl, of all things, purely because at the time I was extremely excited for the release of Splatoon. I'm glad that I was able to experience so many incredible stories because of such a small choice I made years ago. If you're reading this, you should absolutely check out <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/12189/Hyouka" class="font-medium text-primary hover:underline">Hyouka</a> It's easily my favorite anime of all time and I highly recommend everyone give it a shot, it will always have a special place in my heart! :)</p>

									<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Comics</h1>
									<p class="">As long as I can remember, I've adored the world of superhero comics. In fact, some of my earliest memories are playing the original Lego Batman and watching the 2003 Teen Titans cartoon. Despite always adoring adapatations of these characters and their stories, it was only a few years ago when I started to look deeper into the source material itself. It's not as complicated as it seems! Although there's still countless runs I've yet to experience, I look forward to diving deeper into the decades of material available and gaining a new-found appreciate for these characters I've known for so long.</p>

									<h1 class="font-bold text-2xl">Cosplay</h1>
									<p class="">If you asked me a few years ago, I would've been adamant that cosplaying would never be something I would do. How could I? It seemed impossible to even think about putting myself out there in that way. And yet, with the encouragement of some friends, I tried it out for the first time at Anime Expo 2024. Since then, I've done several others, usually Spider-Man, and loved it each time. Conventions can be an incredibly rewarding experience, and if you're considering it, I highly recommend doing your best to overcome the nerves and try it out!</p>
